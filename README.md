# Minecraft-auto-chat
This is an auto chat for Minecraft, entirely made by me. Enjoy!

You don't actaully have to read this, everything here is said by the script but it is more clear on what to do here!

Btw this tutorial is for macOS but you can probally get this on windows or linux too. 

1. Open terminal (Cmd+space, then type terminal)
2. Download or create a python with the script of your choice in it, and move it to documents.
3. Download Homebrew (Unless you already have) at https://brew.sh/ and set it up.
4. Type in terminal: Brew install python3
5. Type in terminal: pip install pynput
6. Type in terminal: pip install pyautogui
7. Make sure terminal has accesibility (Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility > Add terminal with the + at the bottem of the list.)
8. Type in terminal: cd /user/yournamehere/documents/
9. Type in terminal: python3 autochat.py
10. It will be running now!
11. To exit, go to terminal and press cntrl+c

As this script is a bit more advanced than my brackets Plus script, and I put alot of effort into this, please don't reupload this (But at the same time, I don't really care) but you can edit this to your use how ever you like.
I am not responsible for any bad stuff you use this for like typing swear words or stuff like that. Please use this nicely or I will be very sad ):
